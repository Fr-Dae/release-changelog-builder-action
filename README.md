# release-changelog-builder-action

Builds the release notes between two tags (or refs) from pull requests merged.

## Action usage

Include this action in your build by defining the action in your workflow:

```yml
- name: "Build Changelog"
  id: build_changelog
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This will automatically pull the tag from the current commit (the latest tag), and try to resolve the tag before this.

## Action outputs

The result of this action is returned via the outputs, and can be retrieved via the `changelog` value in the step afterwards. See the `test.yml` for a sample.

```yml
${{steps.build_changelog.outputs.changelog}}
```

## Configuration

By default the action will look for a file called `configuration.json` within the root of the repository to load the config from. If this file does not exist, defaults are used.

```
{
    "categories": [
        {
            "title": "## üöÄ Features",
            "labels": ["feature"]
        },
        {
            "title": "## ü¶Ñ Internal Features",
            "labels": ["internal"]
        },
        {
            "title": "## üêõ Fixes",
            "labels": ["fix"]
        },
        {
            "title": "## üß™ Tests",
            "labels": ["test"]
        }
    ],
    "sort": "ASC",
    "template": "${{CHANGELOG}}\n\n<details>\n<summary>Uncategorized</summary>\n\n${{UNCATEGORIZED}}\n</details>",
    "pr_template": "- ${{TITLE}}\n   - PR: #${{NUMBER}}",
    "empty_template": "- no changes",
    "transformers": [
        {
            "pattern": "[\\-\\*] (\\[(...|TEST|CI|SKIP)\\])( )?(.+?)\n(.+?[\\-\\*] )(.+)",
            "target": "- $4\n  - $6"
        }
    ],
    "max_tags_to_fetch": 200,
    "max_pull_requests": 200,
    "max_back_track_time_days": 90,
    "exclude_merge_branches": [
        "Owner/qa"
    ]
}
```

Any section of the configruation can be ommited, to have defaults apply
Defaults for the configuraiton can be found in the [configuration.ts](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action/blob/develop/src/configuration.ts)


## Advanced workflow specification

For advanced usecases additional settings can be provided to the action

```yml
- name: "Complex Configuration"
  id: build_changelog
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
  with:
    configuration: "configuration_complex.json"
    owner: "mikepenz"
    repo: "release-changelog-builder-action"
    ignorePreReleases: "false" # allows to skip any pre releases, if `fromTag` needs to be automatically resolved (ignores 0.0.2-rc02 for example) - only relevant if `fromTag` is not provided
    fromTag: "0.0.2"
    toTag: "0.0.3"
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # the token to use, for a different repository a PAT is required (Personal access token)
```

# Contribute

```bash
# Install the dependencies  
$ npm install

# Build the typescript and package it for distribution
$ npm run build && npm run package

# Run the tests, use to debug, and test it out
$ npm test

# Verify lint is happy
$ npm run lint -- --fix
```

It's suggested to export the token to your path, before running the tests, so API calls can be done to github.

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_github_pat
```
